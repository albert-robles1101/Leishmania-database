# Leishmania-database
Leishmania-database is is the first specific repository of leishmanicidal peptides, which provides information related to their primary structures, origin and biophysical properties calculated by ‘Peptides’ package of the software R. In addition, the life form and species used in bioactivity tests are also included. This information was compiled for analysis and elaboration of the manuscript entitled “Peptides to tackle leishmaniasis: current status and future directions”. Therefore, this resource offers valuable data that can be useful for the design of new peptides active against Leishmania.
