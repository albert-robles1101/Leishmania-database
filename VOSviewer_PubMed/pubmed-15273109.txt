TI  - Role of positional hydrophobicity in the leishmanicidal activity of magainin 2.
PG  - 2980-6
AB  - The emergence of membrane-active antimicrobial peptides as new alternatives against 
      pathogens with multiantibiotic resistance requires the design of better analogues. 
      Among the different physicochemical parameters involved in the optimization of 
      linear antimicrobial peptides, positional hydrophobicity has recently been 
      incorporated. This takes into consideration the concept of the topological 
      distribution of hydrophobic residues throughout the sequence rather than the 
      classical concept of hydrophobicity as a global parameter of the peptide, calculated 
      as the summation of the individual hydrophobicities of the residues. In order to 
      assess the contribution of this parameter to the leishmanicidal mechanisms of 
      magainin 2 analogues, the activities of two of these analogues, MG-H1 
      (GIKKFLHIIWKFIKAFVGEIMNS) and MG-H2 (IIKKFLHSIWKFGKAFVGEIMNI), which have similar 
      charges, amino acid compositions, and hydrophobicities but different positional 
      hydrophobicities, against Leishmania donovani promastigotes were assayed (T. Tachi, 
      R. F. Epand, R. M. Epand, and K. Matsuzaki, Biochemistry 41:10723-10731, 2002). The 
      activities were compared with that of the parental peptide, F5W-magainin 2 
      (GIGKWLHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMNS). The three peptides were active at micromolar 
      concentrations, in the order MG-H2 > MG-H1 > F5W-magainin 2. These activities differ 
      from their hemolytic and bactericidal activities. The results demonstrate that 
      positional hydrophobicity, which reflects the presence of short stretches of 
      sequences rich in hydrophobic amino acids, plays an important role in the activities 
      of leishmanicidal peptides.
