TI  - The role of phosphoglycans in the susceptibility of Leishmania mexicana to the 
      temporin family of anti-microbial peptides.

AB  - Natural product antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been proposed as promising agents 
      against the Leishmania species, insect vector borne protozoan parasites causing the 
      neglected tropical disease leishmaniasis. However, recent studies have shown that 
      the mammalian pathogenic amastigote form of L. mexicana, a causative agent of 
      cutaneous leishmaniasis, is resistant to the amphibian-derived temporin family of 
      AMPs when compared to the insect stage promastigote form. The mode of resistance is 
      unknown, however the insect and mammalian stages of Leishmania possess radically 
      different cell surface coats, with amastigotes displaying low (or zero) quantities 
      of lipophosphoglycan (LPG) and proteophosphoglycan (PPG), macromolecules which form 
      thick a glycocalyx in promastigotes. It has been predicted that negatively charged 
      LPG and PPG influence the sensitivity/resistance of promastigote forms to cationic 
      temporins. Using LPG and PPG mutant L. mexicana, and an extended range of temporins, 
      in this study we demonstrated that whilst LPG has little role, PPG is a major factor 
      in promastigote sensitivity to the temporin family of AMPs, possibly due to the 
      conferred anionic charge. Therefore, the lack of PPG seen on the surface of 
      pathogenic amastigote L. mexicana may be implicated in their resistance to these 
      peptides.
