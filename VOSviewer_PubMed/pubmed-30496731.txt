AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis is one of the most endemic global health problems in many 
      countries all around the world. Pentavalent antimonial drugs constitute the first 
      line of leishmaniasis treatment; however, resistance to these drugs is a serious 
      problem. Therefore, new therapies with new modes of action are urgently needed. In 
      the current study, we examined antimicrobial activity of CM11 hybrid peptide 
      (WKLFKKILKVL-NH2) against promastigote and amastigote forms of L. major 
      (MHRO/IR/75/ER). In vitro anti-leishmanial activity was identified against L. major 
      by parasite viability and metabolic activity after exposure to different peptide 
      concentration. In the presentt study, we demostrated that different concentrations 
      of CM11 result in dose dependent growth inhibition of Leishmania promastigotes. 
      Furthermore, we demostrated that CM11 peptide has significant anti-leishmanial 
      activities on amastigotes. Our results demonstrated that CM11 antimicrobial peptide 
      may provide an alternative therapeutic approach for L. major treatment.
