TI  - Induction of autophagic cell death in Leishmania donovani by antimicrobial peptides.
PG  - 23-35
AB  - We demonstrate that antimicrobial peptides induce an autophagic cell death in the 
      protozoan pathogen, Leishmania donovani. In our study, three antimicrobial peptides, 
      Indolicidin, and two peptides derived from Seminalplasmin exhibit antileishmanial 
      activity with a 50% lethal dose of 3.5 x 10(-5), 3.8 x 10(-4) and 1.7 x 10(-8) 
      microM, respectively. The action of these antimicrobial peptides on the Leishmania 
      cell involves ionic interactions, which are modulated by lipophosphoglycan on the 
      parasite's surface. Peptide treatment caused dissipation of membrane potential and 
      equilibration of intracellular pH with extracellular environment. However, there was 
      no release of intracellular GFP molecules upon peptide treatment of a GFP expressing 
      Leishmania clone. Transmission electron microscopic studies show extensive 
      intracellular damage including cytoplasmic vacuolization and degeneration of 
      cellular organization without disruption of the plasma membrane. These peptides 
      induce cell death via a non-apoptotic process as shown by lack of nuclear 
      fragmentation or DNA laddering and independent of caspase-like activity. Instead, 
      Monodansylcadaverine (MDC), a biochemical marker of autophagy specifically labels 
      the vacuoles induced by peptides. Collectively, these results indicate that in 
      addition to their effects on the leishmanial membrane, these antimicrobial peptides 
      induce pathway(s) for autophagic cell death in L. donovani.
