AB  - Different species of Leishmania are responsible for cutaneous, mucocutaneous or 
      visceral leishmaniasis infections in millions of people around the world [14]. The 
      adverse reactions caused by antileishmanial drugs, emergence of resistance and lack 
      of a vaccine have motivated the search for new therapeutic options to control this 
      disease. Different sources of antimicrobial molecules are under study as 
      antileishmanial agents, including peptides with antimicrobial and/or 
      immunomodulatory activity, which have been considered to be potentially active 
      against diverse species of Leishmania[7,39]. This study evaluated the cytotoxicity 
      on dendritic cells, hemolytic activity, leishmanicidal properties on Leishmania 
      panamensis and Leishmania major promastigotes and effectiveness on parasite 
      intracellular forms (dendritic cells infected with L. panamensis and L. major 
      promastigotes), when each parasite in culture was exposed to different 
      concentrations of a group of synthetic peptides with previously reported 
      antimicrobial properties, which were synthesized based on their naturally occurring 
      reported sequences. Dermaseptin, Pr-2 and Pr-3 showed inhibitory activity on the 
      growth of L. panamensis promastigotes, while Andropin and Cecropin A (with a 
      selectivity index of 4 and 40, respectively) showed specific activity against 
      intracellular forms of this species. The activities of Andropin and Cecropin A were 
      exclusively against the intracellular forms of the parasite, therefore indicating 
      the relevance of these two peptides as potential antileishmanial agents. In the case 
      of L. major promastigotes, Melittin and Dermaseptin showed inhibitory activity, the 
      latter also showed a selectivity index of 8 against intracellular forms. These 
      findings suggest Andropin, Cecropin A and Dermaseptin as potential therapeutic tools 
      to treat New and Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis.
