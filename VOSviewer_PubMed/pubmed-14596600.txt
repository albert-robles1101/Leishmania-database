TI  - Analysis of membrane-binding properties of dermaseptin analogues: relationships 
      between binding and cytotoxicity.
PG  - 12866-74
AB  - To understand relationships between membrane-binding properties of cytolytic 
      peptides and resulting cytotoxicity, we investigated interactions of dermaseptin 
      analogues with model bilayers by means of surface plasmon resonance. First, we 
      tested the system by comparing two native dermaseptins, S1 and S4, whose binding 
      properties were previously characterized in different experimental systems. 
      Validation experiments revealed deviations from the one-to-one interaction model and 
      indicated the binding to proceed by a two-stage mechanism. By calculation of 
      apparent affinity constants and individual affinities for both steps of the 
      interaction, the biosensor technology was able to distinguish between surface-bound 
      peptides that subsequently penetrated into the bilayer and peptides that remained 
      essentially superficially bound. This data interpretation was sustained after 
      analysis of a series of dermaseptin S4 derivatives whose binding data were compared 
      with cytotoxicity, revealing cytolytic activity to correlate mainly with insertion 
      affinity. The data indicate that the potency of highly cytolytic peptides such as 
      K(4)K(20)-S4 is not due to the highest membrane adhesion affinity but to the highest 
      propensity for the inserted state. Similarly, truncated derivatives of 16, 13, and 
      10 residues showed a progressive reduction in cytotoxicity that best correlated with 
      progressive reduction in insertion affinity. Support for the adhesion versus 
      inserted states was provided by proteolytic experiments with RBC-bound peptides that 
      demonstrated K(4)K(20)-S4 to be protected from enzymatic cleavage, unlike its 13-mer 
      derivative. Overall, using the two-stage model proved instrumental in investigating 
      membrane-binding properties of antimicrobial peptides and capable of explaining the 
      cytolytic properties of closely related analogues.
