TI  - Structural requirements for potent versus selective cytotoxicity for antimicrobial 
      dermaseptin S4 derivatives.
PG  - 16941-51
AB  - To better understand the structural requirements for selective cytotoxicity of 
      antimicrobial peptides, seven dermaseptin S4 analogs were produced and investigated 
      with respect to molecular organization in solution, binding properties to model 
      phospholipid membranes, and cytotoxic properties. Native dermaseptin S4 displayed 
      high aggregation in solution and high binding affinity. These properties correlated 
      with high cytotoxicity. Yet, potency was progressively limited when facing cells 
      whose plasma membrane was surrounded by increasingly complex barriers. Increasing 
      the positive charge of the native peptide led to partial depolymerization that 
      correlated with higher binding affinity and with virtually non-discriminative high 
      cytotoxicity against all cell types. The C-terminal hydrophobic domain was found 
      responsible for binding to membranes but not for their disruption. Truncations of 
      the C terminus combined with increased positive charge of the N-terminal domain 
      resulted in short peptides having similar binding affinity as the parent compound 
      but displaying selective activity against microbes with reduced toxicity toward 
      human red blood cells. Nuclear magnetic resonance-derived three-dimensional 
      structures of three active derivatives enabled the delineation of a common 
      amphipathic structure with a clear separation of two lobes of positive and negative 
      electrostatic potential surfaces. Whereas the spatial positive electrostatic 
      potential extended considerably beyond the peptide dimensions and was required for 
      potency, selectivity was affected primarily by hydrophobicity. The usefulness of 
      this approach for the design of potent and/or selective cytolytic peptides is 
      discussed herein.
