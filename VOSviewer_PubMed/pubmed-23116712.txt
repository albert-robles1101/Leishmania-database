AB  - Temporins are a family of short antimicrobial peptides (8-17 residues) that mostly 
      show potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Herein, we demonstrate that 
      temporin-SHd, a 17-residue peptide with a net charge of +2 
      (FLPAALAGIGGILGKLF(amide)), expressed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. 
      This peptide displayed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-negative and 
      Gram-positive bacteria, including multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
      strains, as well as antiparasitic activity against promastigote and the 
      intracellular stage (amastigote) of Leishmania infantum, at concentration not toxic 
      for the macrophages. Temporin-SHd that is structured in a non-amphipathic α-helix in 
      anionic membrane-mimetic environments, strongly and selectively perturbs anionic 
      bilayer membranes by interacting with the polar head groups and acyl region of the 
      phospholipids, with formation of regions of two coexisting phases: one phase rich in 
      peptide and the other lipid-rich. The disruption of lipid packing within the bilayer 
      may lead to the formation of transient pores and membrane permeation/disruption once 
      a threshold peptide accumulation is reached. To our knowledge, Temporin-SHd 
      represents the first known 17-residue long temporin expressing such broad spectrum 
      of antimicrobial activity including members of the trypanosomatidae family. 
      Additionally, since only a few shorter members (13 residues) of the temporin family 
      are known to display antileishmanial activity (temporins-TA, -TB and -SHa), SHd is 
      an interesting tool to analyze the antiparasitic mechanism of action of temporins.
