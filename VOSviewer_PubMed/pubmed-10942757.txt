TI  - Isolation and characterization of gomesin, an 18-residue cysteine-rich defense 
      peptide from the spider Acanthoscurria gomesiana hemocytes with sequence 
      similarities to horseshoe crab antimicrobial peptides of the tachyplesin family.
PG  - 33464-70
AB  - We have purified a small size antimicrobial peptide, named gomesin, from the 
      hemocytes of the unchallenged tarantula spider Acanthoscurria gomesiana. Gomesin has 
      a molecular mass of 2270.4 Da, with 18 amino acids, including a pyroglutamic acid as 
      the N terminus, a C-terminal arginine alpha-amide, and four cysteine residues 
      forming two disulfide bridges. This peptide shows marked sequence similarities to 
      antimicrobial peptides from other arthropods such as tachyplesin and polyphemusin 
      from horseshoe crabs and androctonin from scorpions. Interestingly, it also shows 
      sequence similarities to protegrins, antimicrobial peptides from porcine leukocytes. 
      Gomesin strongly affects bacterial growth, as well as the development of filamentous 
      fungi and yeast. In addition, we showed that gomesin affects the viability of the 
      parasite Leishmania amazonensis.
