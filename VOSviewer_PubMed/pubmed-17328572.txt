TI  - Venturamides A and B: antimalarial constituents of the panamanian marine 
      Cyanobacterium Oscillatoria sp.
PG  - 397-401
AB  - Two new modified cyclic hexapeptides, venturamides A (1) and B (2), were isolated 
      from the marine cyanobacterium Oscillatoria sp. by antimalarial bioassay-guided 
      fractionation. The isolation of 1 and 2 represents the first example of the 
      identification of cyanobacterial peptides with selective antimalarial activity. The 
      planar structures of 1 and 2 were determined by 1D and 2D NMR analyses and, in the 
      case of venturamide A (1), comparison with the literature data for a previously 
      reported synthetic compound. The absolute configuration of the amino acid residues 
      was determined by selective hydrolysis in conjunction with Marfey's analysis. 
      Compounds 1 and 2 were tested for biological activity against a range of tropical 
      parasites.
