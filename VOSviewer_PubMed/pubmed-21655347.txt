AB  - BACKGROUND: Protozoan parasites, such as Leishmania, still pose an enormous public 
      health problem in many countries throughout the world. Current measures are outdated 
      and have some associated drug resistance, prompting the search into novel therapies. 
      Several innovative approaches are under investigation, including the utilization of 
      host defence peptides (HDPs) as emerging anti-parasitic therapies. HDPs are 
      characterised by their small size, amphipathic nature and cationicity, which induce 
      permeabilization of cell membranes, whilst modulating the immune response of the 
      host. Recently, members of the cathelicidin family of HDPs have demonstrated 
      significant antimicrobial activities against various parasites including Leishmania. 
      The cathelicidin bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide 28 (BMAP-28) has broad 
      antimicrobial activities and confers protection in animal models of bacterial 
      infection or sepsis. We tested the effectiveness of the use of BMAP-28 and two of 
      its isomers the D-amino acid form (D-BMAP-28) and the retro-inverso form 
      (RI-BMAP-28), as anti-leishmanial agents against the promastigote and amastigote 
      intracellular Leishmania major lifecycle stages. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An 
      MTS viability assay was utilized to show the potent antiparasitic activity of 
      BMAP-28 and its protease resistant isomers against L. major promastigotes in vitro. 
      Cell membrane permeability assays, caspase 3/7, Tunel assays and morphologic studies 
      suggested that this was a late stage apoptotic cell death with early osmotic cell 
      lysis caused by the antimicrobial peptides. Furthermore, BMAP-28 and its isomers 
      demonstrated anti-leishmanial activities against intracellular amastigotes within a 
      macrophage infection model. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Interestingly, D-BMAP-28 
      appears to be the most potent antiparasitic of the three isomers against wild type 
      L. major promastigotes and amastigotes. These exciting results suggest that BMAP-28 
      and its protease resistant isomers have significant therapeutic potential as novel 
      anti-leishmanials.
