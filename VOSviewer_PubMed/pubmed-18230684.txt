AB  - Histatin 5 (Hst5) is a human salivary antimicrobial peptide that targets fungal 
      mitochondria. In the human parasitic protozoa Leishmania, the mitochondrial ATP 
      production is essential, as it lacks the bioenergetic switch between glycolysis and 
      oxidative phosphorylation described in some yeasts. On these premises, Hst5 activity 
      was assayed on both stages of its life cycle, promastigotes and amastigotes 
      (LC(50)=7.3 and 14.4 microM, respectively). In a further step, its lethal mechanism 
      was studied. The main conclusions drawn were as follows: 1) Hst5 causes limited and 
      temporary damage to the plasma membrane of the parasites, as assessed by electron 
      microscopy, depolarization, and entrance of the vital dye SYTOX Green; 2) Hst5 
      translocates into the cytoplasm of Leishmania in an achiral receptor-independent 
      manner with accumulation into the mitochondrion, as shown by confocal microscopy; 
      and 3) Hst5 produces a bioenergetic collapse of the parasite, caused essentially by 
      the decrease of mitochondrial ATP synthesis through inhibition of F(1)F(0)-ATPase, 
      with subsequent fast ATP exhaustion. By using the Hst5 enantiomer, it was found that 
      the key steps of its lethal mechanism involved no chiral recognition. Hst5 thus 
      constitutes the first leishmanicidal peptide with a defined nonstereospecific 
      intracellular target. The prospects of its development, by its own or as a carrier 
      molecule for other leishmanicidal molecules, into a novel anti-Leishmania drug with 
      a preferential subcellular accumulation are discussed.
