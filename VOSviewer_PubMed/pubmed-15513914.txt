TI  - Temporins, small antimicrobial peptides with leishmanicidal activity.
PG  - 984-90
AB  - Leishmaniasis encompasses a wide range of infections caused by the human parasitic 
      protozoan species belonging to the Leishmania genus. It appears frequently as an 
      opportunistic disease, especially in virus-infected immunodepressed people. 
      Similarly to other pathogens, parasites became resistant to most of the first-line 
      drugs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop antiparasitic agents with new 
      modes of action. Gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides are promising candidates, but 
      so far only a few of them have shown anti-protozoa activities. Here we found that 
      temporins A and B, 13-amino acid antimicrobial peptides secreted from the skin of 
      the European red frog Rana temporaria, display anti-Leishmania activity at 
      micromolar concentrations, with no cytolytic activity against human erythrocytes. To 
      the best of our knowledge, temporins represent the shortest natural peptides having 
      the highest leishmanicidal activity and the lowest number of positively charged 
      amino acids (a single lysine/arginine) and maintain biological function in serum. 
      Their lethal mechanism involves plasma membrane permeation based on the following 
      data. (i) They induce a rapid collapse of the plasma membrane potential. (ii) They 
      induce the influx of the vital dye SYTOX Green. (iii) They reduce intracellular ATP 
      levels. (iv) They severely damage the membrane of the parasite, as shown by 
      transmission electron microscopy. Besides giving us basic important information, the 
      unique properties of temporins, as well as their membranolytic effect, which should 
      make it difficult for the pathogen to develop resistance, suggest them as potential 
      candidates for the future design of antiparasitic drugs with a new mode of action.
