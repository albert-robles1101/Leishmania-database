TI  - Characterization of a defensin from the sand fly Phlebotomus duboscqi induced by 
      challenge with bacteria or the protozoan parasite Leishmania major.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are major components of the innate immune response of 
      epithelial cells. In insect vectors, these peptides may play a role in the control 
      of gut pathogens. We have analyzed antimicrobial peptides produced by the sand fly 
      Phlebotomus duboscqi, after challenge by injected bacteria or feeding with bacteria 
      or the protozoan parasite Leishmania major. A new hemolymph peptide with 
      antimicrobial activity was identified and shown to be a member of the insect 
      defensin family. Interestingly, this defensin exhibits an antiparasitic activity 
      against the promastigote forms of L. major, which reside normally within the sand 
      fly midgut. P. duboscqi defensin could be induced by both hemolymph or gut 
      infections. Defensin mRNA was induced following infection by wild-type L. major, and 
      this induction was much less following infections with L. major knockout mutants 
      that survive poorly in sand flies, due to specific deficiencies in abundant cell 
      surface glycoconjugates containing phosphoglycans (including lipophosphoglycan). The 
      ability of gut pathogens to induce gut as well as fat body expression of defensin 
      raises the possibility that this antimicrobial peptide might play a key role in the 
      development of parasitic infections.
