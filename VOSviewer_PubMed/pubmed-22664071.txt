TI  - Antimicrobial peptide action on parasites.
PG  - 1138-47
AB  - Diseases caused by protozoan parasites can pose a severe thread to human health and 
      are behind some serious neglected tropical diseases like malaria and leishmaniasis. 
      Though several different drugs have been developed in order to eradicate these 
      diseases, a successful candidate has not yet been discovered. Among the most active 
      compounds tested, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are particularly appealing because 
      of their wide spectrum of action. AMPs have been described to perturb protozoan 
      homeostasis by disrupting the cellular membranes but also by interfering with key 
      processes in the parasite metabolism. In this review we describe the diverse 
      mechanisms of action of AMPs on protozoan targets and how they can be exploited to 
      treat diseases. Moreover, we describe with detail the antimicrobial action of AMPs 
      on two major parasitical infections: leishmaniasis and malaria. All the features 
      reviewed here show that AMPs are promising drugs to target protozoan parasites and 
      that further understanding of the mechanism of action of these compounds will lead 
      to improved drugs that could be worth to test in a clinical phase.
