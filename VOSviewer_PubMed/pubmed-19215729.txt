AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are essential for the innate immune system of 
      eukaryotes, imparting protection against pathogens and their proliferation in host 
      organisms. The recent interest in AMPs as active materials in bionanostructures is 
      due to the properties shown by these biological molecules, such as the presence of 
      an alpha-helix structure and distribution of positive charges along the chain. In 
      this study the antimicrobial peptide dermaseptin 01 (DS 01), from the skin secretion 
      of Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis frogs was immobilized in nanostructured layered 
      films in conjunction with nickel tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines. The leishmanicidal 
      activity of DS 01 was confirmed using kinetic essays, in which DS 01 promoted death 
      of all metacyclic promastigote cells in 45 minutes. Surprisingly, the immobilized DS 
      01 molecules displayed electroactivity, as revealed by electrochemical experiments, 
      in which an oxidation peak at about 0.61 V was observed for a DS 01 monolayer 
      deposited on top of a conductive electrode. Such electroactivity was used to 
      investigate the sensing abilities of the nanostructured films toward Leishmania. We 
      observed an increase in the oxidation current as a function of number of Leishmania 
      cells in the electrolytic solution at concentrations down to 10(3) cells/mL. The 
      latter is indicative that the use of AMPs immobilized in electroactive 
      nanostructured films may be of interest for applications in the pharmaceutical 
      industry and diagnosis. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: The recent interest in 
      Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as active materials in bionanostructures is due to the 
      properties shown by these biological molecules. Leishmanicidal activity of a 
      particular AMP is demonstrated in this paper.
