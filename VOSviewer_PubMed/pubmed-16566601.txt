TI  - Effect of natural L- to D-amino acid conversion on the organization, membrane 
      binding, and biological function of the antimicrobial peptides bombinins H.
PG  - 4266-76
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are evolutionarily old components of innate immunity 
      found in all living pluricellular organisms. Interestingly, some organisms express 
      families of AMPs with only a slight variation among their members, possibly to 
      increase their spectrum of activity. Despite the growing body of knowledge about 
      their biological activity and mode of action on bacteria, only a few of them have 
      been tested on Leishmania, a worldwide spread protozoan pathogen, and the parameters 
      contributing to this activity are yet to be determined. We report on the 
      anti-Leishmania activity and mode of action of bombinins H2 and H4 isolated from the 
      skin secretion of the frog Bombina variegata. H4, the most active, is the first 
      natural AMP of animal origin with a single L- to D-amino acid isomerization. 
      Membrane depolarization and membrane permeation assays, as well as electron 
      microscopy, suggest that the lethal mechanism involves plasma membrane permeation 
      and/or disruption. To better understand the enhanced activity of H4, we determined 
      the peptide's structure in membranes mimicking those of mammals, bacteria, and 
      Leishmania by using ATR-FTIR and CD spectroscopies and assessed their membrane 
      binding by using surface plasmon resonance. The data reveal that (i) H2 but not H4 
      partially aggregates in membranes mimicking those of Leishmania, (ii) H2 is slightly 
      more helical than H4 in all membranes, and (iii) H4 binds the Leishmania model 
      membrane approximately 5-fold better than H2. This study highlights the importance 
      of a single alpha-amino acid epimerization as a tool used by nature to modulate the 
      activity of AMPs. In addition, our findings suggest bombinins H as potential 
      templates for the development of new drugs with a new mode of action against 
      Leishmania.
