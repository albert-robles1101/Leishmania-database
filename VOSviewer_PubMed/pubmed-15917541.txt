AB  - To investigate the importance of increased hydrophobicity at the amino end of 
      antimicrobial peptides, a dermaseptin derivative was used as a template for a 
      systematic acylation study. Through a gradual increase of the acyl moiety chain 
      length, hydrophobicity was monitored and further modulated by acyl conversion to 
      aminoacyl. The chain lengths of the acyl derivatives correlated with a gradual 
      increase in the peptide's global hydrophobicity and stabilization of its helical 
      structure. The effect on cytolytic properties, however, fluctuated for different 
      cells. Whereas acylation gradually enhanced hemolysis of human red blood cells and 
      antiprotozoan activity against Leishmania major, bacteria displayed a more complex 
      behavior. The gram-positive organism Staphylococcus aureus was most sensitive to 
      intermediate acyl chains, while longer acyls gradually led to a total loss of 
      activity. All acyl derivatives were detrimental to activity against Escherichia 
      coli, namely, but not solely, because of peptide aggregation. Although aminoacyl 
      derivatives behaved essentially similarly to the nonaminated acyls, they displayed 
      reduced hydrophobicity, and consequently, the long-chain acyls enhanced activity 
      against all microorganisms (e.g., by up to 12-fold for the aminolauryl derivative) 
      but were significantly less hemolytic than their acyl counterparts. Acylation also 
      enhanced bactericidal kinetics and peptide resistance to plasma proteases. The 
      similarities and differences upon acylation of MSI-78 and LL37 are presented and 
      discussed. Overall, the data suggest an approach that can be used to enhance the 
      potencies of acylated short antimicrobial peptides by preventing hydrophobic 
      interactions that lead to self-assembly in solution and, thus, to inefficacy against 
      cell wall-containing target cells.
