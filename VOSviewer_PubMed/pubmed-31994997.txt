AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis are parasitic diseases 
      characterized by skin manifestations. In Brazil, Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis 
      is one of the etiological agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The therapeutic arsenal 
      routinely employed to treat infected patients is unsatisfactory, especially for 
      pentavalent antimonials, as they are often highly toxic, poorly tolerated and of 
      variable effectiveness. This study aimed to evaluate in vitro the leishmanicidal 
      activity of toxins isolated from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom as a new 
      approach for the treatment of leishmaniasis. METHODS: The comparative effects of 
      crotamine, crotoxin, gyrotoxin, convulxin and PLA2 on bone marrow-derived 
      macrophages infected with L. (L.) amazonensis as well as the release of TGF-β from 
      the treated macrophages were studied. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Crotamine had the 
      strongest inhibitory effect on parasite growth rate (IC50: 25.65±0.52 μg/mL), while 
      convulxin showed the weakest inhibitory effect (IC50: 52.7±2.21 μg/mL). In addition, 
      TGF-β was significantly reduced after the treatment with all toxins evaluated. 
      CONCLUSION: The Crotalus durissus terrificus toxins used in this study displayed 
      significant activity against L. (L.) amazonensis, indicating that all of them could 
      be a potential alternative for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
