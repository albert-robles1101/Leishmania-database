AB  - BACKGROUND: Tropical diseases caused by parasites continue to cause socioeconomic 
      devastation that reverberates worldwide. There is a growing need for new control 
      measures for many of these diseases due to increasing drug resistance exhibited by 
      the parasites and problems with drug toxicity. One new approach is to apply host 
      defense peptides (HDP; formerly called antimicrobial peptides) to disease control, 
      either to treat infected hosts, or to prevent disease transmission by interfering 
      with parasites in their insect vectors. A potent anti-parasite effector is bovine 
      myeloid antimicrobial peptide-27 (BMAP-27), a member of the cathelicidin family. 
      Although BMAP-27 is a potent inhibitor of microbial growth, at higher concentrations 
      it also exhibits cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. We tested the anti-parasite 
      activity of BMAP-18, a truncated peptide that lacks the hydrophobic C-terminal 
      sequence of the BMAP-27 parent molecule, an alteration that confers reduced toxicity 
      to mammalian cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: BMAP-18 showed strong growth 
      inhibitory activity against several species and life cycle stages of African 
      trypanosomes, fish trypanosomes and Leishmania parasites in vitro. When compared to 
      native BMAP-27, the truncated BMAP-18 peptide showed reduced cytotoxicity on a wide 
      variety of mammalian and insect cells and on Sodalis glossindius, a bacterial 
      symbiont of the tsetse vector. The fluorescent stain rhodamine 123 was used in 
      immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry experiments to show that BMAP-18 at 
      low concentrations rapidly disrupted mitochondrial potential without obvious 
      alteration of parasite plasma membranes, thus inducing death by apoptosis. Scanning 
      electron microscopy revealed that higher concentrations of BMAP-18 induced membrane 
      lesions in the parasites as early as 15 minutes after exposure, thus killing them by 
      necrosis. In addition to direct killing of parasites, BMAP-18 was shown to inhibit 
      LPS-induced secretion of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine that 
      is associated with inflammation and cachexia (wasting) in sleeping sickness 
      patients. As a prelude to in vivo applications, high affinity antibodies to BMAP-18 
      were produced in rabbits and used in immuno-mass spectrometry assays to detect the 
      intact peptide in human blood and plasma. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: BMAP-18, a 
      truncated form of the potent antimicrobial BMAP-27, showed low toxicity to mammalian 
      cells, insect cells and the tsetse bacterial symbiont Sodalis glossinidius while 
      retaining an ability to kill a variety of species and life cycle stages of 
      pathogenic kinetoplastid parasites in vitro. BMAP-18 also inhibited secretion of 
      TNF-alpha, an inflammatory cytokine that plays a role in the cachexia associated 
      with African sleeping sickness. These findings support the idea that BMAP-18 should 
      be explored as a candidate for therapy of economically important 
      trypanosome-infected hosts, such as cattle, fish and humans, and for paratransgenic 
      expression in Sodalis glossinidius, a bacterial symbiont in the tsetse vector, as a 
      strategy for interference with trypanosome transmission.
