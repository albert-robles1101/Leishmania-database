TI  - Broad spectrum antibiotic activity of the skin-PYY.
PG  - 237-40
AB  - Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and polypeptide YY (PYY) are two ubiquitous neuropeptides, 
      found in brain and intestines, respectively, where they exert important regulatory 
      functions. In this study, a new member of the YY family recently isolated from 
      amphibian skin, skin-PYY (SPYY), is reported to inhibit irreversibly the 
      proliferation of a broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms. NPY and PYY are 
      shown to be endowed with the same activity. Their potency is similar to that of 
      other antibacterial peptides which have been shown to exert their function by 
      disintegrating the bacterial membrane. These findings and the fact that the 
      C-terminal alpha-helical domain SPYY14-36, which is highly conserved among family 
      members, was responsible for killing microorganisms and for permeation of 
      phospholipid vesicles, suggested that the antibiotic activity may emerge via a 
      membrane permeation mechanism. These findings also raise the question whether NPY 
      and PYY exert in vivo a similar function in mammals.
