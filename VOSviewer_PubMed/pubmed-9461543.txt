TI  - The plasma membrane of Leishmania donovani promastigotes is the main target for 
      CA(1-8)M(1-18), a synthetic cecropin A-melittin hybrid peptide.

AB  - Reports on the lethal activity of animal antibiotic peptides have largely focused on 
      bacterial rather than eukaryotic targets. In these, involvement of internal 
      organelles as well as mechanisms different from those of prokaryotic cells have been 
      described. CA(1-8)M(1-18) is a synthetic cecropin A-melittin hybrid peptide with 
      leishmanicidal activity. Using Leishmania donovani promastigotes as a model system 
      we have studied the mechanism of action of CA(1-8)M(1-18), its two parental peptides 
      and two analogues. At micromolar concentration CA(1-8)M(1-18) induces a fast 
      permeability to H+/OH-, collapse of membrane potential and morphological damage to 
      the plasma membrane. Effects on other organelles are related to the loss of internal 
      homeostasis of the parasite rather than to a direct effect of the peptide. Despite 
      the fast kinetics of the process, the parasite is able to deactivate in part the 
      effect of the peptide, as shown by the higher activity of the d-enantiomer of 
      CA(1-8)M(1-18). Electrostatic interaction between the peptide and the promastigote 
      membrane, the first event in the lethal sequence, is inhibited by polyanionic 
      polysaccharides, including its own lipophosphoglycan. Thus, in common with bacteria, 
      the action of CA(1-8)M(1-18) on Leishmania promastigotes has the same plasma 
      membrane as target, but is unique in that different peptides show patterns of 
      activity that resemble those observed on eukaryotic cells.
