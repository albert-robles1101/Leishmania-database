TI  - The major surface-metalloprotease of the parasitic protozoan, Leishmania, protects 
      against antimicrobial peptide-induced apoptotic killing.

AB  - Human infection by the vector-borne protozoan Leishmania is responsible for 
      substantial worldwide morbidity and mortality. The surface-metalloprotease 
      (leishmanolysin) of Leishmania is a virulence factor which contributes to a variety 
      of functions including evasion of complement-mediated parasite-killing and host 
      intramacrophage survival. We tested the hypothesis that leishmanolysin serves to 
      protect parasites from the cytolytic effects of various antimicrobial peptides 
      (AMPs) which are important components of the innate immune system. We found that 
      members of the alpha- and theta-defensins, magainins and cathelicidins had 
      substantially higher leishmanicidal activity against leishmanolysin-knock out 
      mutants of L. major. Using the magainin analogue, pexiganan, as a model peptide we 
      show that AMP evasion is due to rapid and extensive peptide degradation by wild-type 
      parasites. Pexiganan-treatment of knock out mutants induced disruption of 
      surface-membrane permeability and expression of features of apoptosis including 
      smaller cell size, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, exposure of surface 
      phosphatidyl serine as well as induction of caspase 3/7 activity. These results 
      demonstrate leishmanolysin as a virulence factor preventing AMP-mediated apoptotic 
      killing. This study serves as a platform for the dissection of the AMP-mediated 
      death pathways of Leishmania and demonstrates the potential that AMP evasion plays 
      during host infection by this parasite.
