TI  - Identification of Synthetic and Natural Host Defense Peptides with Leishmanicidal 
      Activity.

AB  - Leishmaniaparasites are a major public health problem worldwide. Effective treatment 
      of leishmaniasis is hampered by the high incidence of adverse effects to traditional 
      drug therapy and the emergence of resistance to current therapeutics. A vaccine is 
      currently not available. Host defense peptides have been investigated as novel 
      therapeutic agents against a wide range of pathogens. Here we demonstrate that the 
      antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and the three synthetic peptides E6, L-1018, and RI-1018 
      exhibit leishmanicidal activity against promastigotes and intramacrophage 
      amastigotes ofLeishmania donovaniandLeishmania major We also report that 
      theLeishmaniaprotease/virulence factor GP63 confers protection toLeishmaniafrom the 
      cytolytic properties of alll-form peptides (E6, L-1018, and LL-37) but not thed-form 
      peptide RI-1018. The results suggest that RI-1018, E6, and LL-37 are promising 
      peptides to develop further into components for antileishmanial therapy.
