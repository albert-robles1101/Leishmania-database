TI  - Efficacy of synthetic peptides RP-1 and AA-RP-1 against Leishmania species in vitro 
      and in vivo.

AB  - Host defense peptides are naturally occurring molecules that play essential roles in 
      innate immunity to infection. Based on prior structure-function knowledge, we tested 
      two synthetic peptides (RP-1 and AA-RP-1) modeled on the conserved, microbicidal 
      Î±-helical domain of mammalian CXCL4 platelet kinocidins. These peptides were 
      evaluated for efficacy against Leishmania species, the causative agents of the group 
      of diseases known as leishmaniasis. In vitro antileishmanial activity was assessed 
      against three distinct Leishmania strains by measuring proliferation, metabolic 
      activity and parasite viability after exposure to various concentrations of 
      peptides. We demonstrate that micromolar concentrations of RP-1 and AA-RP-1 caused 
      dose-dependent growth inhibition of Leishmania promastigotes. This antileishmanial 
      activity correlated with rapid membrane disruption, as well as with a loss of 
      mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In addition, RP-1 and AA-RP-1 demonstrated 
      distinct and significant in vivo antileishmanial activities in a mouse model of 
      experimental visceral leishmaniasis after intravenous administration. These results 
      establish efficacy of RP-1 lineage synthetic peptides against Leishmania species in 
      vitro and after intravenous administration in vivo and provide further validation of 
      proof of concept for the development of these and related systemic anti-infective 
      peptides targeting pathogens that are resistant to conventional antibiotics.
