TI  - Anoplin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the venom of the solitary wasp Anoplius 
      samariensis.
PG  - 70-80
AB  - A novel antimicrobial peptide, anoplin, was purified from the venom of the solitary 
      wasp Anoplius samariensis. The sequence was mostly analyzed by mass spectrometry, 
      which was corroborated by solid-phase synthesis. Anoplin, composed of 10 amino acid 
      residues, Gly-Leu-Leu-Lys-Arg-Ile-Lys-Thr-Leu-Leu-NH2, has a high homology to 
      crabrolin and mastoparan-X, the mast cell degranulating peptides from social wasp 
      venoms, and, therefore, can be predicted to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helix 
      secondary structure. In fact, the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of anoplin in the 
      presence of trifluoroethanol or sodium dodecyl sulfate showed a high content, up to 
      55%, of the alpha-helical conformation. A modeling study of anoplin based on its 
      homology to mastoparan-X supported the CD results. Biological evaluation using the 
      synthetic peptide revealed that this peptide exhibited potent activity in 
      stimulating degranulation from rat peritoneal mast cells and broad-spectrum 
      antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 
      Therefore, this is the first antimicrobial component to be found in the solitary 
      wasp venom and it may play a key role in preventing potential infection by 
      microorganisms during prey consumption by their larvae. Moreover, this peptide is 
      the smallest among the linear alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides hitherto found in 
      nature, which is advantageous for chemical manipulation and medical application.
